# CS350-Portfolio

These projects utilized UART and GPIO to display morse code and switch an LED with terminal commands. I think these represent my best work because they operate according to the technical requirements. The codebase could be more succinct but ultimately I am happy with my product. I will continue to utilize Cloud Composer Studio to create embedded projects and implement the TI resources that are available to their audience. This course allowed me to break apart a software development project into components that aren't strictly coding. It helps me realize that I have a lot of skills already to do some of this work -- creating diagrams that represent an application's function -- and turning that into a program itself. This will be useful in the future. Overall, using the conventions of good software development helped me create a maintainable, readable file. I used comments when necessary, without overloading my file with them.
